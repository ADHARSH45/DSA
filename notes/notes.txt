arr = [3,0,1,5,6] after sorting array become ,arr = [0,1,3,5,6] and the iterations start from last so ,
in pass 1: i = 4, and citations.size() - i is 1 it is not grtaer that 6 so skip the pass the 
in pass 2: i = 3,citations.size() - i is 2 which is not greater than 5 so skip 
i pass 3: i = 2,so citations.size() - i become 3 which is equal to citations[i] return i + 1


in array like [100] the out put is one ;

in array like [0,0,2]
